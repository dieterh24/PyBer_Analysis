PyBer Analysis (Ride Share Data)

1.	Overview of the analysis:
Using data from three different types of cities, we performed an analysis on ride share data to see what the data would reflect (meaning what is like about them, and what is different about them).  The three city types used are urban, suburban and rural.   

2.	Results:
Below are the differences in the ride share data for the three city types.  The ride share data includes: 1. the total rides, 2. total drivers, 3. total fares, 4. average fare per ride, and 5.  Average fare per driver by city type.  We had one outlier in the urban ride count. 
       City Type	Total Rides	Total Drivers	Total Fares	Avg Fare per Ride	Avg Fare per Driver
       Rural	        125	       78	          $4,327.93	     $34.62 	           $55.49 
       Suburban	 625	      490	          $19,356.33	     $30.97 	           $39.50 
       Urban	       1625	     2404	          $39,854.38	     $24.53 	           $16.57 

3.	Summary:
The rural city type reflects the highest average fare per ride and highest average fare per driver with the lowest number of rides and drivers.  The suburban city type reflects an average of $6 more per ride, and about $23 more per driver than the urban city type.  The urban city type shows the highest number of rides and drivers.  The urban city also had the lowest average fare per ride and average fare per driver.  Due to the number of rides and drivers available in the urban city type, the total fares collected is much higher than rural and suburban cities.  Other recommendations to look at in the city types:
a.  Find out if there are drivers registered for a mix of city types.  Meaning, how many drivers are giving rides in rural, suburban and urban areas, (any mix of the three city types).
b.  Look at the mileage per ride.  Are the drivers in rural areas driving more miles than in urban areas (on average).
c.  Analysis the wait time from a time a call is made for a pickup to the time the driver arrives to pickup a customer.  This may help decide if the location of drivers makes sense of if adjustments should be made to have less or more drivers in a given area.
